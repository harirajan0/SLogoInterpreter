/*
 * This design takes advantage of interfaces and inheritance simultaneously. This interface prescribes 
 * 3 methods that all commands must implement. The reason this is useful is because we can now classify
 * all commands - math, turtle, and control - under the umbrella of "Command." This allows us to work
 * with Commands abstractly without knowing which specific type. This interface reduces duplicated code
 * and makes it easy for somebody to add new commands. This interface is implemented by the abstract super-
 * classes like ControlCommandMasterpiece (featured in this masterpiece) or their subclasses.
