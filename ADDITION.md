##Estimation
* How long will it take?
Adding the two subclasses of command will take only a few minutes. Figuring out how to add clones of the turtle image views to the root, and later remove them, should not be difficult, but I feel as though my inexperience with frontend will cause it to take up to an hour.
* How many files will I need to add or update? Why?
 I will need two add two new command classes. I will need to add those two command classes to the command factory. I will need to modify the TurtleWindowView to support stamping (adding to the root) and clearing (removing).
