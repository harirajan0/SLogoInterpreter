Information about using the project:
-------------
Commands that are typed into the command prompt are executed by pressing the “execute” button.

You must select at least one turtle for commands to take effect. If you successfully select a turtle, a confirmation window will pop up. If it does not pop up, keep clicking the turtle close to its center until a window pops up. Sometimes it is hard to click the turtle. 


Impressions:
-------------
This project forced us to learn to communicate effectively between frontend and backend. This project had some interesting and rewarding challenges like solving the parsing problem using abstract syntax trees. This project is rewarding to use because we can see the results on the screen.
