CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===================

*Note: Sorry this wasn't committed prior to writing the code. I accidentally had this in my analysis_hpr4 repository instead. But, I did answer the "Estimation" questions prior to writing the code.*

###Estimation

I think that it shouldn't take me much longer than 30 minutes to complete the frontend addition. I know I will have to edit the CommandPromptView.java class to simply add a button that will open a new window for the user to change the turtle image. Also, I will need to write a new class called TurtleImageChanger.java which opens up a new window for users to view the current images and change the images. I also know that I will need to add a method in SLogoController.java to add a listener to the choice box in TurtleImageChanger.java. Lastly, I will have to add a short method in SLogoData.java to change the image of an individual turtle.
